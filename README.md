## NodeJS-RoadMap

# Prerequisites
## 1 .JavaScript
If you are a frontend developer looking to master some backend skills then you don't have to spend a huge amount of time learning JavaScript before getting started with building Node.js applications. But in case if you are a complete beginner who’s looking to master Node.js in the minimum possible time then you must learn the following concepts before you deep dive into the Node.js environment.

### Arrow Functions
### Types
### Expressions
### Functions
### Lexical Structures
### this
### Loops and Scope
### Arrays
### Template Literals
### Strict Mode
### ES6/ES7<br>

## 2. NPM

Node Package Manager is the world’s largest Software Registry with over 800,000 code packages. Using NPM the right way can help a lot as managing packages becomes pretty handy with NPM while we develop applications that require a number of dependencies.<br>

NPM consists of three distinct components:<br>


The Command Line Interface (CLI): It runs in the machine’s terminal environment and how most of the developer interact with NPM<br>
The Registry: A large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information.<br>
The Website: You can discover new packages, and manage other aspects of your npm experience.<br>
NPM is used for managing multiple versions of code and code dependencies, run packages without downloading them (using npx), and many more.<br>
